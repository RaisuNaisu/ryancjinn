## Ryan Lim Chien Jinn

I am an international student currently classified as a senior and I’m majoring in Management information Systems (MIS) at the University of Oklahoma. I am expecting to graduate in December of 2019. 

Through my classes and campus involvement here at the University of Oklahoma as well as INTI International College Penang, I have been able to develop my analytical, leadership, and communication skills. During my internship in Penang, Malaysia with Flex Ltd this past summer, I have learned to adapt to the working environment and have a better insight on how to behave more professionally in the process. I have also gained considerably time management skills juggling my daily education workload while working part time to lessen the financial burden of my family as a student employee at Wagner Dining Hall in Oklahoma. Customer service skills are thoroughly honed working here in the United States after having constantly improve myself since I was a student ambassador at INTI International College Penang. Throughout my working experience, I learnt that to complete a given assignment timely we need to have clear objective, good communication skills, excellent teamwork among the team members with a diligence and perseverance attitude.

I know that with the experience from my previous internship, and the job skills acquired working in a diverse selection of part-time jobs over the years, I would able to contribute towards the workforce as a team player. I am currently also taking up e-commerce and some programming classes that consists of working with SQL, HTML, C#, MVC, WPF. Through these classes, I am confident to face the essential tasks and challenges that this position has to offer.
