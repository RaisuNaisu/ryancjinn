                <p>
                   I am an international student currently classified as a senior and Iâ€™m majoring in Management information Systems (MIS) at the University of Oklahoma. I am expecting to graduate in December of 2019.

                    Through my classes and campus involvement here at the University of Oklahoma as well as INTI International College Penang, I have been able to develop my analytical, leadership, and communication skills. During my internship in Penang, Malaysia with Flex Ltd this past summer, I have learned to adapt to the working environment and have a better insight on how to behave more professionally in the process. I have also gained considerably time management skills juggling my daily education workload.
